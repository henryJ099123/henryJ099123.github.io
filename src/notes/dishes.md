# Wash the Dishes

After living on my own for a few months,
I started to realize just how much
the errands and chores of daily life start to weigh on you.
This was my first exposure to the regular(ish) nine-to-five, 
and in addition to my forty-minute commute,
It was basically 6pm by the time I would return to my apartment.
Then, I needed to cook for myself, 
and then when I was done eating, there was always one final hurdle:
washing the dishes.

It's so easy to just leave the dishes for the next day.
It makes ending my day just a bit earlier, 
giving me some more minutes for relaxation
(or realistically, scrolling), 
letting me retain just a *bit* more of my sanity.
Sure, it makes my life a bit harder tomorrow morning,
and it leaves the apartment a bit dirtier,
and a bit less nice to stay in,
but all of that is worth the trade-off.

Right?

One night,
witnessing the dishes accumulate from both myself and my roommates, 
feeling the pull to just sit down and go on my phone,
I instead shook my head, buckled down,
and went to work.

I grabbed one dish, took the sponge, lathered the thing in soap, rinsed it, 
put it on the drying rack.

I grabbed the next plate, took the sponge, washed it, rinsed it, placed it to the side.

Grab, wash, rinse, place.

Repeat.

The process became almost meditative, 
and for once, I had time to let my mind wander without distraction..
I started to think about doing the dishes, and why we do them,
and more importantly,
why I should do them now, instead of later.

There's clear, surface-level reasons for doing the dishes.
It makes the apartment cleaner and the kitchen nicer to look at.
Less grime in the air, fewer bugs around, that sort of deal.

Grab, wash, rinse, place.

That may be the literal effect of washing the dishes, but
I started to wonder, why *really* do we do the dishes? 
Maybe I'm asking the wrong question.
Maybe instead I ask, *who* am I washing the dishes for?

There's my roommates&mdash;washing the dishes makes it easier for them. 
They don't have to wash the dishes that are mine.
And I could even wash theirs, just because.
Plus, their next adventure in the kitchen will just be a bit simpler with clean dishes.
Grab, wash, rinse, place.
I know that *I've* been incredibly frustrated by roommates leaving dirty dishes overnight.
This just makes their lives a bit easier too.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't washing the dishes for myself, either.
It turns my experience in the kitchen from subtle disgust 
of the cobbled-together pile of dinner remains
to something I'm more proud of.

It gives me a sense of accomplishment in many ways:
from the initial choice to overcome my inertia and start washing,
to the satisfaction of finishing something and doing it well,
completing a job in full,
to putting a nice cap to the day 
and making future relaxation just *that* much more comfortable.

I want to re-emphasize that point of *doing something well*.
Grab, rinse, wash...but this placing was interrupted,
as I realized that the plate I was fitting into the drying rack
was going up against another plate that wasn't clean at all,
and somehow, against all odds, beat the allegations of being dirty
and ended up behind enemy lines.
I took the dish and placed it on top of the stack in the sink.
What's worse than not doing the dishes is doing a half-ass job of it.
It's as if you didn't do the job at all.

At this point in my meditation,
I started to think more about my motivations for washing the dishes.
The pride of doing something well is admirable, but it's self-centered.
And doing this chore for my roommates isn't that much more noble,
as it's more me remembering my annoyance when *they* don't do the dishes.

So, what *should* my motivations be?

Grab, wash, rinse, place.

I started to think of why I would think to do the dishes at all,
and my parents started to roll over in my head.
I remembered of the constant nitpicks to finish the dishes,
reminders about wiping up the standing water around the sink,
pains at forgetting the pot of lukewarm pasta water sitting
on the stove behind me.

I used to do the dishes because they told me to.
In a sense, I was doing the dishes for them.

I've already listed lots of other reasons for doing the dishes already,
but that's no real reason why this motivation needs to go the way of the dodo.
Washing the dishes to make someone else proud is noble,
and honestly, it's the one that feeds back best into my own satisfaction
at completing the task.

I know not everyone is religious, but the natural conclusion of this 
was to conclude that I should be doing the dishes for God,
to make Him proud, as if He were coming over at that second.

> who's normally not one to take advice from,
> but for once, she has a point here.

If that doesn't work for you, think of your parents, or a good friend,
and out of love for them, do the dishes. Or make your bed.
Or finish that paper draft, or assignment. And fo it **now**.
But make sure to *do it well*,
and if you notice something more, something small, to do it better...do it.

With no more dishes to grab, I took some paper towels
and mopped up the standing water that accumulated around the faucet of the sink.
No job's done until it's done.
And then I walked to the couch, sat down, and could truly relax.

At least until tomorrow, with more dishes to do. 
But maybe it's not such a bad thing to do anymore.
