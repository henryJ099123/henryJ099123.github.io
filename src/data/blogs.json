I won't repeat my bio at length, which you can see on the main page\nof this site, but in case you somehow missed that, my name is Henry Jochaniewicz.\nI'm a current junior at the **University of Notre Dame** studying computer science\nwith minors in mathematics and theology.\n\nDespite how much I enjoy math and CS, I still like to read and write, and think\nit's a necessary skill to keep. I also really, *really* like sharing what I know\nwith other people and teaching the things I know; there's a reason I've been an\nundergraduate teaching assistant for three semesters now. So, I think having\nan outlet and repository for the things I write is a good, useful endeavor.\n\nMost of the notes I write are probably going to be related to computer science,\nprobably as a way to prove to myself I'm actually learning in my classes\nby explaining the concepts I know to the void.\nSome might instead be opinion pieces related to programming, like on valid\nsyntax highlighting or something like that.\nSome of these probably *won't* be CS related; I like video games, books,\nmovies, origami, and lots of other things, so if inspiration strikes, maybe\nI'll write a video game review or something like that and put it here.\n\nRegardless, I hope that these little notes that I write are useful to someone,\nand at least are enjoyable to read.\n\n"
