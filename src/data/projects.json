Part of the book is building an interpreter with Java for Nystrom's fake programming language Lox, and in the future, using C for more low-level programming instead of Java's high-level features.",

I programmed Voronoi diagrams, the Mandelbrot set, and various cool-looking motions. Click on the shaders to cycle through some of the <a href=\"https://github.com/henryJ099123/shader_practice\" target=\"_blank\">ones I made</a> (and try moving your mouse over some!).",
