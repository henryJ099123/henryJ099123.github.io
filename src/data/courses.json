      "description": "This is an introductory programming and C course that introduces fundamental principles of computer science, from formulating a problem and analyzing it conceptually, to designing, implementing, and testing a program on a computer. The course went over C fundamentals up to and including pointers. Example projects from the class are a Conway's Game of Life simulator, a crossword puzzle generator, fractal designs, and a final project, for which I remade Tetris using X11 graphics. Click to the right to download it yourself (I still play it from time to time)!",

Topics include permutations, divisibility, modular arithmetic, cryptography, cyclic and dihedral groups, Lagrange's theorem, homomorphisms, ideals, integral and Euclidean domains, extension fields. My final paper for the class at right was a research and discussion on Boolean algebras that culminated in a proof of isomorphism between some set and the power set both as Boolean algebras and Boolean rings.",

      "description": "Introduction to formal languages and automata, computability theory, and complexity theory with the goal of developing understanding of the power and limits of different computational models. Topics covered include: regular languages and finite automata; context-free grammars and pushdown automata; Turing machines; undecidable languages; the classes P and NP; NP completeness. For the class, designed in a group a nondeterministic finite automaton simulator to match strings, a regular expression matcher Ã  la grep that uses said NFA simulator to efficiently match strings, a sed-like programming language, and a regex matcher with backreferences. We also proved the regex matcher with backreferences was NP-complete by reducing 3SAT to it."
