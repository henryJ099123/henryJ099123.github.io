        "description": "This is a research internship under Dr. Michael Niemier that took place in Lyon, France at Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon. With 4 other undergraduate students, I benchmarked figures of merit for different AES hardware accelerators from more than 11 academic research papers to compare to an under-development AES chip. To demonstrate trends in that data, I wrote up Python files and a Google Colab session to automatically generate graphs. These graphs and data were shown off in sponsor presentations! We additionally did some research on applying emerging memory technologies, specifically ferroelectrics, to an AES accelerator and presented a modified bitcell using 1FeFET-1C cells for the SubBytes step of encryption. Lastly, we formally presented our findings and contributions to over 30 PhD students and our advisor.<br></br>Beyond the research, being in France for two months was an incredible opportunity to engage with international students and a brand-new culture (and learn a bit of French)."

        "description":"Domer Rover is an engineering build club where our goal is to build a rover for the University Rover Competition. I served as the Radio and Communications Lead this past year, so I taught myself all about radios, earned a Technician-level Ham radio license (callsign KE9AZR), and developed a communication network between the rover and our base station over two frequency bands. The 900MHz band was essentially serial, so I designed a single-stream message-based weighted-round-robin communication system to accomodate this and handle potential dips in communication. The rover sends photos, driving controls, status signals, and video at a distance, and in testing this system works at over a kilometer distance! Check out our SAR video embedded here to hear me talk about it.",

        "description": "In Fall of 2024, I was a teaching assistant for Discrete Mathematics for a class of about 50 students. I held office hours once a week, coordinated with four other TAs and the instructor, and even taught myself content new to this isntructor in order to help students. In Spring 2025, I was a grader for Magic of Numbers, a mathematics seminar for about fifteen first-year students, and I provided tailored feedback on each homework assignment. For Fall 2025, I am a Fundamentals of Computing TA, explaining introductory C, the command line, and basic programming skills at weekly labs, during my office hours, and by grading homework assignments."

I collaborated with my coworkers to serve lines of 100+ people for ice cream nearly every summer weekend, and I consistently worked about 25 hours/week in the summer and during all breaks. I also helped train a few new hires."
