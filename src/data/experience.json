        "description": "This is a research internship under Dr. Michael Niemier that took place in Lyon, France, partnered with Ecol√® Centrale de Lyon. With four other undergraduate students, I benchmarked various figures of merit for different AES hardware accelerators and developed Python files and Google Colab sessions to automatically generate graphs of desired data points. Beyond the research, being in France for two months was an incredible opportunity to engage with international students and a brand-new culture (and learn a bit of French)."

        "description":"Domer Rover is an engineering build club where our goal is to build a rover for the University Rover Competition. I served as the Radio and Communications Lead this past year, so I taught myself all about radios, earned a Technician-level Ham radio license, and developed a communication network between the rover and our base station over two frequency bands. The 900MHz band was essentially serial, so I designed a single-stream message-based weighted-round-robin communication system to accomodate this and handle any potential dips in communication. Testing showed this system works at over a kilometer distance! Check out our SAR to the right.",

        "description": "In Fall of 2024, I was a teaching assistant for Discrete Mathematics for a class of about 50 students. I held office hours once a week, coordinated with four other TAs and the instructor, and taught myself content new to this semester in order to help students. In Spring 2025, I was a grader for Magic of Numbers, a mathematics seminar for about fifteen first-year students. For Fall 2025, I will be a Fundamentals of Computing TA for second-years."
