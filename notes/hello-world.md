# Hello, World

Hello, world! I won't repeat my bio at length, which you can see on the main page
of this site, but in case you somehow missed that, my name is Henry Jochaniewicz.
I'm a current junior at the **University of Notre Dame** studying computer science
with minors in mathematics and theology.

Despite how much I enjoy math and CS, I still like to read and write, and think
it's a necessary skill to keep. I also really, *really* like sharing what I know
with other people and teaching the things I know; there's a reason I've been an
undergraduate teaching assistant for three semesters now. So, I think having
an outlet and repository for the things I write is a good, useful endeavor.

Most of the notes I write are probably going to be related to computer science,
probably as a way to prove to myself I'm actually learning in my classes
by explaining the concepts I know to the void.
Some might instead be opinion pieces related to programming, like on valid
syntax highlighting or something like that.
Some of these probably *won't* be CS related; I like video games, books,
movies, origami, and lots of other things, so if inspiration strikes, maybe
I'll write a video game review or something like that and put it here.

Regardless, I hope that these little notes that I write are useful to someone,
and at least are enjoyable to read.
